# Thesis
# Project Overview

This repository contains scripts and tools used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis related to my Thesis. The project focuses on AIS (Automatic Identification System) data for time series forecasting. Below is a brief description of the key components of this project:

## Data Cleaning
- `Brest2015_Clean.py` and `Europe2015.py` are Python scripts used for data cleaning in the Brest region and Europe datasets.

## Data Import
- `importBrest2015.py`, `importEU2015.py`, `importPortsBrittany.py`, and `importShapefile.py` are Python scripts responsible for importing CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

## Data Processing and Harmonization
- `data_evaluations.sql` contains SQL scripts for data processing and harmonization, aiming to prepare the data for further analysis.

## Data Queries
- `queries.sql` includes SQL queries used for extracting insights and information from the dataset.

## Time Series Forecasting
- `ais.py` contains Python code for time series forecasting using AIS data.

Please refer to the individual files for more detailed documentation. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance with this project.

**Note:** This README is a work in progress and will be updated with more information as the project evolves.
